A diff tool for YAML files, and sometimes JSON

## Description

`dyff` is inspired by the way the old [BOSH v1](https://bosh.io/) deployment output reported changes from one version to another by only showing the parts of a YAML file that change.

Each difference is referenced by its location in the YAML document by using either the [Spruce](https://github.com/geofffranks/spruce) or [go-patch](https://github.com/cppforlife/go-patch) path syntax. The output report aims to be as compact as possible to give a clear and simple overview of the change.

Similar to the standard `diff` tool, it follows the principle of describing the change by going from the `from` input file to the target `to` input file.

Input files can be local files (filesystem path), remote files (URI), or the standard input stream (using `-`).

All orders of keys in hashes are preserved during processing and output to the terminal, most notably in the sub-commands to convert YAML to JSON and vice versa.

## Installation

### Homebrew

The `homeport/tap` has macOS and GNU/Linux pre-built binaries available:

```bash
brew install homeport/tap/dyff
```

### Snap

It is [available in the `snapcraft` store](https://snapcraft.io/dyff) in the Productivity section.

```bash
snap install dyff
```

### Pre-built binaries in GitHub

Prebuilt binaries can be [downloaded from the GitHub Releases section](https://github.com/homeport/dyff/releases/latest).

### Curl To Shell Convenience Script

There is a convenience script to download the latest release for Linux or macOS if you want to need it simple (you need `curl` and `jq` installed on your machine):

```bash
curl --silent --location https://git.io/JYfAY | bash
```

### Build from Source

Starting with Go 1.17, you can install `dyff` from source using `go install`:

```bash
go install github.com/homeport/dyff/cmd/dyff@latest
```

_Please note:_ This will install `dyff` based on the latest available code base. Even though the goal is that the latest commit on the `main` branch should always be a stable and usable version, this is not the recommended way to install and use `dyff`. If you find an issue with this version, please make sure to note the commit SHA or date in the GitHub issue to indcate that it is not based on a released version. The version output will show `dyff version (development)` for `go install` based builds.

## Use cases and examples

- Show differences between the live configuration of Kubernetes resources and what would be applied (`kubectl` version >= `v1.20.0`):

  ```bash
  # Setup
  export KUBECTL_EXTERNAL_DIFF="dyff between --omit-header --set-exit-code"

  # Usage
  kubectl diff [...]
  ```

  ![dyff between example with kubectl diff](.docs/dyff-between-kubectl-diff.png?raw=true "dyff in kubectl diff example")

  The `--set-exit-code` flag is required so that the `dyff` exit code matches `kubectl` expectations. An exit code `0` refers to no differences, `1` in case differences are detected. Other exit codes are treated as program issues.
  
  _Note:_ Versions of `kubectl` older than `v1.20.0` did not split the environment variable into field, therefore you cannot use command arguments. In this case, you need to wrap the `dyff` command with its argument into a helper shell script and use this instead.

- Show the differences between two versions of [`cf-deployment`](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/) YAMLs:

    ```bash
    dyff between \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/v1.10.0/cf-deployment.yml \
      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/v1.20.0/cf-deployment.yml
    ```

    ![dyff between example](.docs/dyff-between-deployment-manifest-example.png?raw=true "dyff between example of two cf-deployment versions")

- Embed `dyff` into **Git** for better understandable differences

    ```bash
    # Setup...
    git config --local diff.dyff.command 'dyff_between() { dyff --color on between --omit-header "$2" "$5"; }; dyff_between'
    echo '*.yml diff=dyff' >> .gitattributes

    # And have fun, e.g.:
    git log --ext-diff -u
    git show --ext-diff HEAD
    ```

- Convert a JSON stream to YAML

    ```bash
    sometool --json | jq --raw-output '.data' | dyff yaml -
    ```

- Sometimes you end up with YAML or JSON files, where the order of the keys in maps was sorted alphabetically. With `dyff` you can restructure keys in maps to a more human appealing order:

    ```bash
    sometool --export --json | dyff yaml --restructure -
    ```

    Or, rewrite a file _in place_ with the restructured order of keys.

    ```bash
    dyff yaml --restructure --in-place somefile.yml
    ```

- Just print a YAML (or JSON) file to the terminal to look at it. By default, `dyff` will use a neat output schema which includes different colors and indent helper lines to improve readability. The colors are roughly based on the default [Atom](https://atom.io) schema and work best on dark terminal backgrounds. The neat output is disabled if the output of `dyff` is redirected into a pipe, or you can disable it explicitly using the `--plain` flag.

    ```bash
    dyff yaml somefile.yml
    ```

- Convert a YAML file to JSON and vice versa:

    ```bash
    dyff json https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment/v1.19.0/cf-deployment.yml
    ```

    The `dyff` sub-command (`yaml`, or `json`) defines the output format, the tool automatically detects the input format itself.

    ```bash
    dyff yaml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/homeport/dyff/main/assets/bosh-yaml/manifest.json
    ```
